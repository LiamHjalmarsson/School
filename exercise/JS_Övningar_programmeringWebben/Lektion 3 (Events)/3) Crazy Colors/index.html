    <h1>Indeed, programming is hard</h1>
    <p class="quote">“We choose to go to the moon in this decade, not because it is easy, but because it is hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.”<br> — John F Kennedy</p>
    <p>Because it is hard, it is a skill that not so many have.</p>
    <p>Because it is hard, mastering it may strengthen your self-esteem. Ok, true, not everyone needs more of that.</p>
    <p>Because it is hard, it will help you train your focus and attention.</p>
    <p>Because it is hard, when your code works, you get a nice rush. No risks and no drugs involved.</p>
    <p>Also, it's lots of fun, but that's not because it is hard.</p>
